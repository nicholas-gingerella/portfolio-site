            A software engineer currently living and working in my hometown of Riverside, California.

          <p>
            When I'm not building software at work,

            I'm not afraid to step out of my comfort zone to embrace new challenges, where I can learn and explore new
            technology and opportunities.

                Communicating technical concepts to children who had never programmed was quite the challenge, and I
