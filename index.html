                During my time as a student at the University of California Riverside, I took on a position as an
                assistant instructor for Python programming class for 9th grade students at a local middle school
                sponsored by the university.
              </p>
              <p>
                My primary role was to teach the class the fundamentals for programming using Python through a series of
                classes held throughout the quarter.
              </p>
              <p>
                Communicating technical concepts to children who had never programmed was quite the challenge, and I
                learned a lot about communication and fostering a comfortable learning environment for these newcomers.
              </p>
              <p>
                But even with all the hurdles faced, that class performed beautifully, and by the end of the quarter,
                they
                were all armed with a new tool at their disposal and a new found appreciation for the applications they
                use every day.

                one of my professors past students. It was here I got my first taste of working in a team and delivering
                a
                tangible product.
              </p>
              <p>
                I helped create content management systems using a LAMP stack for server side processing (Linux, Apache,
                MySQL, and PHP) and HTML, CSS, and Javascript/JQuery for frontend development. Our customers ranged from
                small local businesses to large corporations such as Phillips Healthcare.
