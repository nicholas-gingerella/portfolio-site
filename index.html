            <p>To reduce the clutter and complexity behind big systems, I focus on creating logical abstractions built
              on
              a foundation of clean, readable code for us mere mortals to understand. Using clean code and solid
              engineering processes, my goal is to bring these benefits to the projects I work on:</p>

              For quick prototypes or tooling, Python is my go to. Simple to use, but powerful due to its many
              libraries. Python has been growing on me, and I’m excited to dive deeper into the language and its ever
              growing applications.

            <p>
              I’ve been creating and maintaining software for communication systems used in both commercial and
              government sectors.

              The projects I’ve worked on vary, from simple command line tools for Linux networking configurations, to
              graphical user interfaces for complex communications systems used government agencies.

              My more recent duties include:
              - Requirements development
              - Interface design
              - Software design and implementation

              I also help improve the software development processes of my team in need by introducing and incorporating
              crucial development tools such as version control and continuous integration and test suites.

              Python Programming Teaching Assistant

              February 2014 - May 2014

            <p>
              During my time as a student at the University of California Riverside, I took on a position as an
              assistant instructor for Python programming class for 9th grade students at a local middle school
              sponsored by the university.

              My primary role was to teach the class the fundamentals for programming using Python through a series of
              classes held throughout the quarter.

              Communicating technical concepts to children who had never programmed was quite the challenge, and I
              learned a lot about communication and fostering a comfortable learning environment for these newcomers.

              But even with all the hurdles faced, that class performed beautifully, and by the end of the quarter, they
              were all armed with a new tool at their disposal and a new found appreciation for the applications they
              use every day.

            </p>
            <p>
              The first job I took on during my days in community college was with a small local startup that was run by
              one of my professors past students. It was here I got my first taste of working in a team and delivering a
              tangible product.

              I helped create content management systems using a LAMP stack for server side processing (Linux, Apache,
              MySQL, and PHP) and HTML, CSS, and Javascript/JQuery for frontend development. Our customers ranged from
              small local businesses to large corporations such as Phillips Healthcare.

              Aside from cutting my teeth on some real world projects and improving my development skills, it’s here
              that I learned to ask questions and get feedback that would help me improve craft.
