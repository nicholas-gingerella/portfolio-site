# Nicholas Gingerella - Software Engineer
This is a simple little personal website to host my resume, as well as info for any small projects I'm working on.
After nearly 5 years as a software engineer in the defense industry, I felt it was time to start expanding my skillset
and re-explore some of my old web development skills in the process.

After reading through the latest edition of the
[Pragmatic Programmer](https://pragprog.com/book/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition), I found myself yearning
for different challenges and exposure to problem domains such as Artificial Intelligence, Graphics, VR, and AR. These are the fields
that got me interested in programming in the first place, yet have drifted so far away from me in these past 5 years...

With my work primarily being C++ in a Linux environment, with bits of Python mixed in for simple script work here and there,
I'd like to take this as an opportunity to start exploring these languages in more depth, and pick up some new languages as well.


## Project 1 - Portfolio Site (HTML, CSS, Javascript)
The jumping off point of this journey. Re-learning some basic web development and design skills through the development of this
site should be a good starting point, as it lets me more easily communicate other projects that I begin playing around with.
When you want to tell people about that sweet program you wrote about, it really helps to have a means of demonstrating your work
in an easily accessible way...you know...like a website!

Lets face it, not everyone wants to go through the process of downloading
and compiling your source code just to see your work, but have a snazzy webpage complete with screenshots and gifs may convince them
to give it a shot!
